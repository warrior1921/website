        <h1>How And Why It Was Created ?</h1>
        <p>
       Warriora AI was created by Vishesh Kannaujiya as part of his journey to learn and experiment with new technologies. With a strong curiosity for how things work, he wanted to test the process of building an AI chatbot and understand its working at a basic level. Using API key integration methods, he connected language models to a simple interface, which gave him practical experience in combining coding with artificial intelligence. While Warriora AI is not presented as a highly advanced project, it proved very helpful in developing skills and gaining insights into chatbot design and functionality. For Vishesh, the real value of this project lies in the learning process, experimentation, and the confidence it gave him to explore technology further.

<section class="faq">
  <h2 id="fa">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <!-- Question 1 -->
   <div class="mart">
  <details>
    <summary>What is Warriora AI?</summary>
    <p>Warriora AI is a chatbot created to give users a space to interact with artificial intelligence in a simple and accessible way. It is not built as a big commercial platform but as a project to understand how AI systems actually function. The chatbot can hold conversations, answer questions, and even provide explanations on different topics. Unlike advanced bots, it is more about demonstrating possibilities than competing with large companies. Warriora AI works in a clean and focused environment, avoiding distractions. It also highlights the importance of learning through projects. The main goal behind Warriora AI is to make AI feel approachable. In short, it’s a personal step into the world of conversational AI.</p>
  </details>

  <!-- Question 2 -->
  <details>
    <summary>Who Created It?</summary>
    <p>

        Warriora AI was created by Vishesh Kannaujiya, a student with a strong passion for learning technology. He wanted to explore artificial intelligence not just in theory but also through real practice. Instead of only reading about chatbots, he decided to make one himself. This allowed him to understand integration methods like API connections, handling responses, and styling outputs. The project also gave him insight into how AI can be shaped to interact with people. It was never meant to be perfect or advanced but rather a hands-on way to gain skills. The process of building Warriora AI was just as important as the final chatbot itself. It reflects curiosity and self-driven learning.
    </p>
  </details>

  <!-- Question 3 -->
  <details>
    <summary>
        Is Warriora AI advanced like other big chatbots?
    </summary>
    <p>No, Warriora AI is not at the same level as professional or commercial AI chatbots. It does not contain millions of features or large-scale data systems. Instead, it is a smaller project focused on showing how AI conversations can work. Its responses are limited compared to highly advanced models, but it still creates meaningful interactions. The purpose was never to compete but to learn and grow. By experimenting with Warriora AI, Vishesh gained a better understanding of natural language processing basics. For users, it gives a simple but interesting experience. It is proof that even small steps in AI can teach a lot.</p>
  </details>

   <!-- Question 4 -->
  <details>
    <summary>Why should I try Warriora AI?</summary>
    <p>You should try Warriora AI because it gives you a chance to experience an AI chatbot made from scratch by a student learner. It does not overwhelm you with unnecessary features but keeps the chat simple and easy to use. The design is clean, mobile-friendly, and focuses only on chatting. It is also refreshing because it is not a copy of advanced bots—it carries a personal touch. By using it, you support the idea of learning through building. You may also find inspiration if you are interested in creating projects yourself. Trying Warriora AI shows how curiosity can turn into something interactive. It’s a small project with a meaningful vision.</p>
  </details>

  <!-- Question 5 -->
  <details>
    <summary>Can Warriora AI answer all kinds of questions?</summary>
    <p>Warriora AI can answer many general questions and provide useful information, but it does have limitations. It is not designed to cover every possible subject in detail. The chatbot works best for casual conversation, explanations, and simple queries. Sometimes it may not have complete or perfect answers. This is natural because it is a learning project, not a commercial service. However, its strength lies in showing how a chatbot can handle user input and provide meaningful responses. It encourages people to see both the strengths and weaknesses of AI at this level. Users can still learn a lot while interacting with it. That balance makes it interesting to try.</p>
